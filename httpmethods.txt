A way of telling the server what type of request we are making...
-Get
-Post
-Put
-Delete

form a get request from our API, return a list in json format...then return that json back.

need a database/ mongoDB.

from a front-end/3rd party app
make a request
go to APIget data from database, back to API and then front end
Post request create new data

Get Request retrieves information then sends it

update/edit existing data
-Put request

Delete Data
-Delete request

CRUD-Create, Read, Update, Delete

API routes- commutication with API,
Get request, retrieves a list from a route.
for a POST request we use the same data
Put request add a different request.  has more information because the information already exists

Delete data, we would go to the same route as a PUT request because we are deleting existing information.

When we send data to the same requests., we say what kind of requests we are making.
Then in the query we are putting the method, example as POST.

Then if we want a GET request we change the method, even though it has the same route.
